# Applied Network Administration and Security Lab

This repository documents the projects and tasks completed during my summer internship at the **S√ºleyman Demirel University IT Department** (Network and System Administration unit) in August 2025.

The main objective of this internship was to apply theoretical networking concepts to real-world scenarios using both physical and virtual hardware. This repository serves as a portfolio of the skills I gained in system administration, network segmentation, and security configuration.

## üîß Key Projects and Skills Learned

### 1. Multi-Layered Virtual Network Laboratory
I designed and implemented a complete virtual corporate network using VirtualBox and OPNsense.
- **Learned Skills:**
  - Deployed and configured a professional-grade firewall/router (OPNsense).
  - Created multiple, isolated network segments (`YONETIM`, `YAZILIM`, `DMZ`, `VERITABANI`) to simulate a secure corporate architecture.
  - Implemented inter-network routing and DHCP services for each segment.
  - **See configuration details:** [`configs/opnsense-firewall-rules.md`](Configs/opnsense-firewall-rules.md)

### 2. Physical Switch Configuration (HP ProCurve 2626)
Gained hands-on experience with enterprise-grade network hardware.
- **Learned Skills:**
  - Connected to a managed switch via console port using PuTTY.
  - Implemented network segmentation using **VLANs**.
  - Configured **Trunk Ports** to carry multi-VLAN traffic.
  - **See configuration details:** [`configs/hp2626-vlan-config.md`](Configs/hp2626-vlan-config.md)

### 3. Network Automation Scripting
Developed a Python script to automate network monitoring tasks.
- **Learned Skills:**
  - Used Python libraries like `socket` to check the status of critical network services (HTTP, MySQL, SSH).
  - Automated `ping` tests to verify host reachability.
  - **See the script:** [`scripts/network_monitor.py`](Scripts/network_monitor.py)

### Career Impact

This internship was a definitive experience that solidified my interest in **Network Engineering and Cybersecurity**. The hands-on challenges and problem-solving involved in configuring and securing a network were far more engaging than my previous academic focus on pure software development.
